## Current State Assessment

### Product Design: 9/10
**Strengths:**
- Clinical terminal aesthetic is high-vibe and differentiated.
- "Patience Tax" provides a clear psychological hook.
- Real on-chain Ethos integration proves technical legitimacy.

**Gaps:**
- Wallets are anonymous; missing the "human" behind the trades.
- Cross-chain analysis is siloed (users must choose one or the other).
- Missing viral loop for feed-based distribution.
