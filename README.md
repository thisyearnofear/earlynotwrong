# EARLY, NOT WRONG

> Being early feels like being wrong. Until it doesn't.

An agentic on-chain behavioral analysis app that helps crypto traders understand whether their biggest losses came from being wrong — or from not staying right long enough.

---

## Core Thesis

In asymmetric markets, conviction isn't tested when you're wrong — it's tested when you're early. Losses are capped (−1x), but wins are uncapped. The most expensive mistake isn't being wrong — it's selling winners too early.

## The Problem

Crypto traders systematically:
- Exit profitable positions prematurely due to volatility or social pressure
- Hold losers longer than winners, despite asymmetric payoff structures
- Misinterpret "early" as "wrong" due to short-term drawdowns
- Lack objective, wallet-level evidence of how patience/impatience affects their P&L
- Have no portable reputation that proves their conviction quality across platforms

**No tool exists that reframes trading history through the lens of conviction vs timing, and no composable reputation layer captures this behavioral truth.**

---

## What It Does

An autonomous agent that analyzes historical trades on Solana and Base to:

### Identify:
- Positions sold early before significant upside
- Losses capped correctly vs allowed to spiral
- Drawdowns that preceded outsized gains

### Quantify:
- Dollar value of impatience vs conviction
- Asymmetry score (capped losses vs uncapped gains captured)
- Patience tax (value lost to premature exits)

### Surface:
- **"Early, Not Wrong" events** — trades exited at loss/small gain that later mooned
- **Conviction wins** — holding through drawdowns → outsized returns
- **False conviction** — stubbornness that destroyed asymmetry

---

## User Flow

1. Connect wallet (Solana/Base or both) + Ethos profile
2. Agent autonomously explores token interactions, entry/exit timing, holding periods, post-exit price trajectories
3. Receive **Conviction Report** with behavioral scores, missed upside vs avoided downside, comparative insights
4. **Conviction Index accrues to your Ethos reputation** — portable, composable, credibility-backed

---

## Innovation: Conviction Index (CI) as Reputation

A wallet-level score measuring how consistently a trader:
- Allows upside to compound
- Caps downside efficiently
- Holds through drawdowns when asymmetry remains
- Avoids reflexive exits

**CI is not performance. CI is behavior under uncertainty.**

### Conviction Labels:

| Label | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| **High Conviction** | Rare trades, large outcome dispersion, thesis-driven exits |
| **Early but Right** | Often underwater initially, disproportionate upside capture |
| **Reactive** | High turnover, frequent early exits, low asymmetry |
| **Stubborn** | Holds losers beyond asymmetry, low signal quality |

## Ethos Integration: Reputation as Infrastructure

### Why Ethos?

Conviction is meaningless if it's siloed. Ethos makes behavioral reputation **composable, portable, and credible** across the crypto ecosystem.

### How We Integrate:

#### 1. Credibility Score as Entry Point
- Use Ethos credibility score to filter out sybil wallets and wash trading
- Only analyze wallets with sufficient on-chain reputation to ensure signal quality
- Prevents gaming: conviction analysis requires real trading history

#### 2. Conviction Index → Ethos Reputation
- CI scores are written to user's Ethos profile as attestations
- Behavioral labels (High Conviction, Early but Right, etc.) become reputation badges
- Creates a **reputation-native trading identity** that travels with the wallet

#### 3. Reputation-Gated Insights
- Advanced analytics unlock based on Ethos credibility tier
- Higher reputation users access comparative cohort data
- Creates incentive alignment: build reputation, unlock deeper self-knowledge

#### 4. Social Layer via Ethos Profiles
- Users can display their Conviction Index publicly on Ethos
- Other traders filter wallets by CI percentile using Ethos API
- **"Quiet conviction" becomes discoverable reputation** before performance shows

#### 5. Meta-Signal Attribution
When a high-CI wallet (verified via Ethos) enters/exits/holds:
- *"This wallet [Ethos credibility: 850] ranks 92nd percentile for upside capture"*
- *"This wallet [Ethos credibility: 450] historically exits winners early"*
- Ethos credibility score adds trust layer to behavioral insights

#### 6. Reputation Staking (Future)
- Wallets can stake Ethos reputation on their conviction thesis
- False conviction degrades Ethos score
- Proven conviction compounds reputation
- Creates **skin-in-the-game for signal quality**

### Technical Integration:
- **Ethos API** for credibility score queries and attestation writes
- **Reputation-weighted analytics** (higher Ethos score = access to richer comparative data)
- **Composable reputation:** CI becomes queryable via Ethos by any dApp
- **Slash protection:** Gaming detection triggers Ethos reputation penalties

## What This Is NOT

❌ Trading bot  
❌ Signals platform  
❌ Leaderboard for speculation  
❌ Financial advice  

**This is self-knowledge for asymmetric markets — backed by portable, composable reputation.**

---

## Meta-Signal Layer

Not trade copying. Not alerts. **Meta-signal about the trader, not the trade** — verified and weighted by Ethos credibility.

The app doesn't tell you what to buy. It tells you **how seriously to take a wallet's action**, backed by their reputation.

---

## Tone & Aesthetic

Calm, clinical, contrarian. Minimalist, data-forward. No hype, no price predictions. 

Inspired by value investing, risk asymmetry, behavioral finance, quiet conviction.

**Ethos integration is invisible to the user** — reputation just works, accrues, and compounds naturally.

---

## Success Metrics

- "I didn't realize how much upside I gave away" moments
- Users discovering non-obvious behavioral mistakes
- Conviction Index accruing to Ethos profiles
- Cross-platform reputation portability
- High-CI wallets becoming discoverable via Ethos before alpha emerges

---

## Chain Support

**Initial:** Solana, Base  
**Vision:** Chain-agnostic, reputation-composable across all EVM and non-EVM chains

---

## Philosophy

**In asymmetric markets, conviction itself is a signal — but only if it's earned.**

**With Ethos, that conviction becomes reputation you can take anywhere.**
